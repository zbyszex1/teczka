The application was saved in GitHub as public because I made it for my own use and retained the copyright. It was made in the Angular 15 framework and presents archival data that I obtained from the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. From 1979 to 1998 I was active in the democratic opposition for an independent state and the defense of citizens' rights, and for this reason I was under surveillance by the political police before the Iron Curtain fell.

The application presents scanned documents and auxiliary data saved in JSON format. The source code structure includes the following subdirectories: classes, components, directives, pages and pipes. The appearance is controlled by scss files.

The name index was done with a help of the app https://github.com/zbyszex1/index.
